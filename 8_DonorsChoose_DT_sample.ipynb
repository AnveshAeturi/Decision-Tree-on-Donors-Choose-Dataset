      "My students are English learners that are working on English as their second or third languages. We are a melting pot of refugees, immigrants, and native-born Americans bringing the gift of language to our school. \\r\\n\\r\\n We have over 24 languages represented in our English Learner program with students at every level of mastery.  We also have over 40 countries represented with the families within our school.  Each student brings a wealth of knowledge and experiences to us that open our eyes to new cultures, beliefs, and respect.\\\"The limits of your language are the limits of your world.\\\"-Ludwig Wittgenstein  Our English learner's have a strong support system at home that begs for more resources.  Many times our parents are learning to read and speak English along side of their children.  Sometimes this creates barriers for parents to be able to help their child learn phonetics, letter recognition, and other reading skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy providing these dvd's and players, students are able to continue their mastery of the English language even if no one at home is able to assist.  All families with students within the Level 1 proficiency status, will be a offered to be a part of this program.  These educational videos will be specially chosen by the English Learner Teacher and will be sent home regularly to watch.  The videos are to help the child develop early reading skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nParents that do not have access to a dvd player will have the opportunity to check out a dvd player to use for the year.  The plan is to use these videos and educational dvd's for the years to come for other EL students.\\r\\nnannan\n",

      "The 51 fifth grade students that will cycle through my classroom this year all love learning, at least most of the time. At our school, 97.3% of the students receive free or reduced price lunch. Of the 560 students, 97.3% are minority students. \\r\\nThe school has a vibrant community that loves to get together and celebrate. Around Halloween there is a whole school parade to show off the beautiful costumes that students wear. On Cinco de Mayo we put on a big festival with crafts made by the students, dances, and games. At the end of the year the school hosts a carnival to celebrate the hard work put in during the school year, with a dunk tank being the most popular activity.My students will use these five brightly colored Hokki stools in place of regular, stationary, 4-legged chairs. As I will only have a total of ten in the classroom and not enough for each student to have an individual one, they will be used in a variety of ways. During independent reading time they will be used as special chairs students will each use on occasion. I will utilize them in place of chairs at my small group tables during math and reading times. The rest of the day they will be used by the students who need the highest amount of movement in their life in order to stay focused on school.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever asked what the classroom is missing, my students always say more Hokki Stools. They can't get their fill of the 5 stools we already have. When the students are sitting in group with me on the Hokki Stools, they are always moving, but at the same time doing their work. Anytime the students get to pick where they can sit, the Hokki Stools are the first to be taken. There are always students who head over to the kidney table to get one of the stools who are disappointed as there are not enough of them. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe ask a lot of students to sit for 7 hours a day. The Hokki stools will be a compromise that allow my students to do desk work and move at the same time. These stools will help students to meet their 60 minutes a day of movement by allowing them to activate their core muscles for balance while they sit. For many of my students, these chairs will take away the barrier that exists in schools for a child who can't sit still.nannan\n",

      "How do you remember your days of school? Was it in a sterile environment with plain walls, rows of desks, and a teacher in front of the room? A typical day in our room is nothing like that. I work hard to create a warm inviting themed room for my students look forward to coming to each day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy class is made up of 28 wonderfully unique boys and girls of mixed races in Arkansas.\\r\\nThey attend a Title I school, which means there is a high enough percentage of free and reduced-price lunch to qualify. Our school is an \\\"open classroom\\\" concept, which is very unique as there are no walls separating the classrooms. These 9 and 10 year-old students are very eager learners; they are like sponges, absorbing all the information and experiences and keep on wanting more.With these resources such as the comfy red throw pillows and the whimsical nautical hanging decor and the blue fish nets, I will be able to help create the mood in our classroom setting to be one of a themed nautical environment. Creating a classroom environment is very important in the success in each and every child's education. The nautical photo props will be used with each child as they step foot into our classroom for the first time on Meet the Teacher evening. I'll take pictures of each child with them, have them developed, and then hung in our classroom ready for their first day of 4th grade.  This kind gesture will set the tone before even the first day of school! The nautical thank you cards will be used throughout the year by the students as they create thank you cards to their team groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour generous donations will help me to help make our classroom a fun, inviting, learning environment from day one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt costs lost of money out of my own pocket on resources to get our classroom ready. Please consider helping with this project to make our new school year a very successful one. Thank you!nannan\n",

      "The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. -William A. Ward\\r\\n\\r\\nMy school has 803 students which is makeup is 97.6% African-American, making up the largest segment of the student body. A typical school in Dallas is made up of 23.2% African-American students. Most of the students are on free or reduced lunch. We aren't receiving doctors, lawyers, or engineers children from rich backgrounds or neighborhoods. As an educator I am inspiring minds of young children and we focus not only on academics but one smart, effective, efficient, and disciplined students with good character.In our classroom we can utilize the Bluetooth for swift transitions during class. I use a speaker which doesn't amplify the sound enough to receive the message. Due to the volume of my speaker my students can't hear videos or books clearly and it isn't making the lessons as meaningful. But with the bluetooth speaker my students will be able to hear and I can stop, pause and replay it at any time.\\r\\nThe cart will allow me to have more room for storage of things that are needed for the day and has an extra part to it I can use.  The table top chart has all of the letter, words and pictures for students to learn about different letters and it is more accessible.nannan\n",

      "My kindergarten students have varied disabilities ranging from speech and language delays cognitive delays gross fine motor delays to autism They are eager beavers and always strive to work their hardest working past their limitations The materials we have are the ones I seek out for my students I teach in a Title I school where most of the students receive free or reduced price lunch Despite their disabilities and limitations my students love coming to school and come eager to learn and explore Have you ever felt like you had ants in your pants and you needed to groove and move as you were in a meeting This is how my kids feel all the time The want to be able to move as they learn or so they say Wobble chairs are the answer and I love then because they develop their core which enhances gross motor and in Turn fine motor skills They also want to learn through games my kids do not want to sit and do worksheets They want to learn to count by jumping and playing Physical engagement is the key to our success The number toss and color and shape mats can make that happen My students will forget they are doing work and just have the fun a 6 year old deserves nannan\n"
